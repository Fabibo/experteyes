Steps

Record your data and somehow get them on a computer in some movie format.

To import the new data:

From the terminal, run ffmpeg:

Note different video recording devices need different ffmpeg parameters. 
For videos recorded using a java program ( .AVI ) or from a DV cam (.dv)
ffmpeg -i stream2001.avi -deinterlace /Volumes/Eyebook4/Michigan/AllanMich/eye/eye_%5d.tiff
or
ffmpeg -i stream2001.dv -deinterlace /Volumes/Eyebook4/Michigan/AllanMich/eye/eye_%5d.tiff

For videos recorded using a new HDV camera. ( .MOV encoded with H.264 format )
ffmpeg -i FILE0001.MOV  -pix_fmt h264 /Volumes/Spudnik/VidcamTesting/Eye/eye/eye_%5d.tiff



Repeat for the Scene movie.

Note that you must create the scene and eye folders before running these commands.
